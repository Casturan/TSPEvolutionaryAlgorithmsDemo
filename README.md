Evolutionary Algorithms Traveling Salesman Problem
==========

This is the Evolutionairy Algorithm Demo for the Traveling Salesman Problem that I use to demo the simplicity and power of Evolutionairy Algoritms.

To run it, just clone this repository by using your favorit git gui or executing 

```
git clone https://github.com/bknopper/TSPEvolutionaryAlgorithmsDemo.git
```

Because this demo uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as package manager / build automation system and has the Gradle wrapper incorporated you can run this demo by simply executing the gradle wrapper.

For example, from the TSPEADemo directory, run:

```bash
./gradlew run
```
This should start resolving all the dependency and start the demo for you.

Have fun!
